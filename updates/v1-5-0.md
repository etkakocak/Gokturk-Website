# Version 1.5.0  
## What's new?
* The website has a ``link`` and a ``domain`` which can be accessed by users now.  

* The website has been published in ``Google Search Console`` and can be accessed by the users who search for the website in ``search engines`` now. 

* Fixed some style issues when viewing the website on the mobile.

* Fixed some grammatical issues in the texts on the website.
&nbsp;

## Things to fix with updates in the project:
* The ``dictionary application`` on the ``language page`` is in the demo version. It should be upgraded to the full version.  
    * The dictionary system of the JavaScript program works in the demo version for now. But there are a lot of words to add and this is no longer a JavaScript job and a back-end technology needs to be used.    
    &nbsp;

* The ``Read Info`` buttons on the ``Bumin, Istemi and Etmish pages`` are still empty, the pages with information about the rulers should be added to the project.  
    * Opening an HTML page for all the rulers will not be an adequate solution. A cloud system should be used. A good framework should be used to prevent slowdowns on the website.  
    &nbsp;

* More historical information about the state should be included on the website.
    * The information available on the website is limited for now and more historical content should be added. More historical content is unlikely to be made with more front-end, and back-end should be used for new long content.
